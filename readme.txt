**1) Dedicated refund system**
With our Return Refund and Exchange plugin, merchants can create a dedicated refund system where they can build an email template to send to the customers who ask for a refund. Merchants can add the name, email, email header, and footer for their email template.

**2) Predefined Refund Reason**
Merchants can add multiple reasons for a product refund. Customers can select any of these reasons while asking for a refund with the help of Warranties & Returns For WooCommerce.

**3) Mail Notification For Refund**
Merchants can notify the customers of different scenarios for the product refund. They can create different emails if a refund request is generated, approved, or cancelled. Merchants can add a different subject line and content for every scenario. They can also use Shortcodes to add elements to the email content.

**4) Efficient Tax Handling**
With our Refund and Exchange plugin, merchants can handle the tax on the refund products easily. They can simply enable or disable the tax calculation on the refund products by going to the plugin settings and enabling the “Enable Tax” option.

**5) Stock Management**
Our Refund Management Plugin provides a feature to manage stock. Merchants need to enable this feature from the plugin settings. Once you enable this feature, the product stock will be increased whenever a refund request is accepted.

**6) Refund on selected order status**
You can select the order status on which a customer can submit a refund request. You can select either a single or multiple order status in this setting. For example, if you select Completed, and Failed order statuses, you’ll allow your customers to generate a refund request if their order is completed, or failed.

You can allow your customers to send you the order related queries. Furthermore, you can also enable/disable the settings to let your customers add the attachments along with their messages.
